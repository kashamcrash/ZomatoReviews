Create a model to predict the rating in a review based on the content of the text

Users on Zomato post reviews of restaurants and provide a rating accompanying the review. The content in the reviews should ideally reflect the rating provided by the customer. In many cases, there is a mismatch, owing to multiple reasons, where the rating does not match the customer review. The reviews and rating match is very important as it builds customer trust on the platform and helps the user get an accurate picture of the restaurant. Identify and clean such cases to ensure the ratings reflect the reviews and that the reviews seem trustworthy to the customer in order to predict/match the correct rating from/to the review text.
